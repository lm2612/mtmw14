    "The equations must be examined under different situations to decide which method is suitable. **RE WRITE- generalise. not just for mu v large and mu v small** In the absence of non-linearity ($\\epsilon=0$) and wind stress $\\xi=0$, if $\\mu$ is strong enough, the RT term dominates the time evolution of T and the T grows exponentially while the $\\alpha b T$ term dominates the h equation and h grows exponentially negative. If $\\mu$ is too weak, $-rh$ dominates the equation for h causing an exponential decay in h and $\\gamma h$ dominates the equation for T, causing rapid decay for T also. Finally, for a critical value of $\\mu$ which would cause a balancing of the terms, both T and h will oscillate. Hence, the requirement for the method is that it is accurate for oscillatory, growth and decay problems.
